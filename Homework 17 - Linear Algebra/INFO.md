# Homework 17 - Problem 1 Info
---
Develop a MATLAB function that determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix. Your algorithm must use partial pivoting.

For full credit, you must include appropriate error checking. If you are confused about what would be appropriate or have questions, feel free to come to office hours!

Remember, a correctly solved LU factorization solves for the problem P*A = L*U, which is a good check to make sure your solution is correct.
