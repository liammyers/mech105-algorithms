# Homework 11 - Problem 1 Info
---
Develop a MATLAB function which estimates the root of a given function.

Note: As a reference you can find the bisection algorithm from Figure 5.7 in your book and as a referene in the second problem. Don't copy it blindly, but instead try and make your own bisection method and compare it to the book solution. If you make that function first, you are well on the way to getting this assigment figured out.
